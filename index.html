    <h1>Things that Pop into Austin183's Head</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>
            This is a compilation of programming projects that can be run directly from the Web Browser.  They are meant to be educational for both the user and the me, the programmer.
        </p>
        <h2>About the Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
            If you are interested in what my current development environment looks like, I describe it here: <a href="AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html">This Development Environment</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Tax Bracket Visualizations</h2>
        <a href="TaxBracketVisualizer/index.html">View a collection of interactive charts and graphs demonstrating how Income Tax Brackets work</a>
        <p>
            Have you ever heard someone say a pay increase could actually result in a pay decrease because Tax Brackets?  This perception is the result of a misunderstanding of how taxes increase per bracket.  I hope this project makes it easier to understand how tax brackets really work to eliminate the perceived "pay decrease" windows around the edge of brackets.

        <h2>Midi Song Builder</h2>
        <a href="MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html">Play A Keyboard Piano</a>
        <p>
            I hear I can power a midi synthesizer with javascript and modern web browsers. I don't have a real piano or musical keyboard, but I have my laptop keyboard.  This is my attempt to turn my web browser into a musical instrument I can annoy my dog with.
        </p>

        <h2>Midiestro</h2>
        <a href="MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html">Play a rhythm typing game with MIDI files</a>
        <p>
            This page lets you drag a midi file onto the page and play along with it by matching key presses as they fall down the screen, like a rythm game.  There are also several pre-loaded songs so you don't have to download midi files.
        </p>

        <h2>Blog Posts</h2>
        <a href="BlogPosts/index.html">Read about the Development History for various projects on the site</a>
        <p>
            This page has a collection of pages particular commits from the github repo for this website.  These complete the loop, bridging the code for the pages with the thoughts in my head.  It's kind of like Inception for this website.
