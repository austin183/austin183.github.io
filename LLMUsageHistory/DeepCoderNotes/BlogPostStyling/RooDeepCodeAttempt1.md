[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task. 
(This is an automated message, so do not respond to it conversationally.)
