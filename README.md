Where stuff gets published

Right now, I wanted to publish a self contained html page that could demonstrate how Tax Brackets work while also learning a couple of new libraries.

I found Vue.JS and Chart.JS to be easy to use.

https://vuejs.org/
https://www.chartjs.org/

Update 02/05/2022 - My initial goal of havinng a single page got constricting, so I moved some code to other js files to separate concerns and cut down on line count in index.html directly.

Also started using Plotly for x/y/z graphing
