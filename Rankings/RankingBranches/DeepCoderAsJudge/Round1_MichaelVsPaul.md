**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Patches:**
   - Both patches aim to add theme switching functionality to blog posts, including dark/light themes and enhanced styling.

2. **Comparing the Approaches:**
   - **PatchMichael:**
     - Uses external CSS and JS files.
     - Implements CSS variables for theming.
     - Stores theme preference in localStorage for persistence.
     - Keeps HTML clean by separating styles and scripts.
   - **PatchPaul:**
     - Adds classes directly to the body element for themes.
     - Includes JavaScript inline within HTML files.
     - Uses basic CSS without variables.

3. **Evaluating Good Practices:**
   - **Michael's Strengths:** External files, CSS variables, localStorage usage improve maintainability and scalability.
   - **Paul's Weaknesses:** Inline JS clutters HTML; direct class manipulation is less flexible.

4. **Considering Future Extensibility:**
   - Michael's approach allows easier addition of more themes or styles without altering multiple HTML files.
   - Paul's method might become messy as more features are added, due to inline scripts and lack of separation.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - PatchMichael is better because it adheres to best practices, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable. His use of external resources and modern CSS techniques provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

**Answer:**

After carefully analyzing both patches, I conclude that PatchMichael's approach is superior. Here's why:

- **Best Practices:** Michael separates concerns by using external CSS and JS files, which makes the codebase easier to manage and update.
- **Scalability:** His use of CSS variables allows for easy theme management and potential addition of more themes in the future.
- **Persistence:** By storing the theme preference in localStorage, Michael ensures that the user's choice is remembered across sessions, enhancing usability.

In contrast, PatchPaul's inline JavaScript within HTML files can lead to clutter and makes maintenance harder. His approach, while functional, lacks the structure and scalability of Michael's implementation.

Therefore, I would choose **PatchMichael.diff** as it demonstrates a more robust and maintainable solution.
