# The Ladder Results
## Round 1:
* PatchCarolyn vs PatchJennifer: Carolyn wins
* PatchLinda vs PatchPamela: Linda wins
* PatchRiver vs PatchSamantha: Samantha wins
* PatchStacey vs PatchTricia: Tricia wins
* PatchChristopher vs PatchCollin: Christopher wins
* PatchDavid vs PatchLeonard: Leonard wins
* PatchMichael vs PatchPaul: Michael wins
* PatchRandy vs PatchTimothy: Timothy wins

## Round 1 testing gender biased
* PatchCarolyn vs PatchCollin: Carolyn wins

## Round2:
* Carolyn vs Linda: Carolyn wins
* Samantha vs Tricia: Samantha wins
* Christopher vs Leonard: Christopher wins
* Michael vs Timothy: Michael wins

## Round3:
* Caryolyn and Christopher were Lama33
* Samantha and Michael are DeepCoder
* DeepCoder called it a split, where Lama33 was a simpler approach, but DeepCoder was better maintainability:
```
If I had to choose one patch, I would lean towards PatchCarolyn.diff because it's simpler and gets the job done effectively. However, if I wanted a more robust solution with better maintainability and responsiveness, I might consider building upon Samantha's approach by simplifying some of its complexity while retaining the responsive design features.
```

# Conclusion

DeepCoder said DeepCoder was best.  

It was pretty good, so I don't disagree on that front.  It says the code can be simplified though, so maybe once I choose one to go with, I can further refactor to get it just right.

# Further Considerations
Perhaps I should try to mix up the male and female names more and get more variety in the ladder since all the patches are already listed twice.
