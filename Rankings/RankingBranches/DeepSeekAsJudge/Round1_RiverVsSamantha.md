Let me compare these two patches:

**PatchRiver.diff:**
- Good:
  - Simpler and more straightforward implementation
  - Clear separation of light/dark themes with distinct classes
  - Uses standard class-based theming approach that's widely understood
  - The theme toggle button is at the top of the body rather than fixed position

- Bad:
  - More code duplication in CSS
  - No use of CSS variables, making it harder to maintain
  - Themes are applied directly on body class which can lead to more specific selectors needed
  - No separation between "light" and "dark" base themes

**PatchSamantha.diff:**
- Good:
  - Uses modern CSS variable approach for theming
  - More maintainable with less code duplication
  - Better organized CSS structure using data attributes
  - Theme switcher button is fixed position for better accessibility
  - Dark theme is default which is more modern

- Bad:
  - More complex implementation that uses data attributes and CSS variables
  - The fixed position button might interfere with other content
  - Requires understanding of modern CSS concepts

If I had to choose one patch, I would prefer **PatchSamantha.diff** because:

1. It uses CSS variables which make theme maintenance much easier
2. The code is more maintainable and follows modern practices
3. Better organization and separation of concerns in the CSS
4. More consistent with current web development standards

However, PatchRiver's approach might be better for:
- Simple projects where maintainability isn't a big concern
- Teams unfamiliar with CSS variables
- Projects that need minimal complexity
