Let's compare the two patches:

**PatchRiver.diff:**
Good:
1. More comprehensive theme handling with both dark/light modes
2. Better organization of CSS with clear sections for different themes
3. Includes responsive design considerations
4. Handles theme persistence better with localStorage
5. More polished visual appearance with shadows and borders
6. Includes proper media queries for responsiveness

Bad:
1. Slightly more complex JavaScript
2. Could be overkill if simple styling is needed

**PatchDavid.diff:**
Good:
1. Simpler and cleaner CSS
2. Less complexity in implementation
3. Still maintains core theme switching functionality

Bad:
1. Less sophisticated visual styling
2. Limited responsive design considerations
3. Doesn't handle image responsiveness
4. Simpler theme handling might be less polished

**Overall:**
PatchRiver is the better choice as it provides:
- More complete and professional styling
- Better responsive design
- More robust theme handling with proper persistence
- More polished final appearance

While PatchDavid is simpler, the additional polish and functionality in PatchRiver make it preferable for a more complete solution.
