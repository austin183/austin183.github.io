## Core Principles

### SOLID Principles

Review for adherence to SOLID design principles:

| Principle | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | Does each module/factory have one clear reason to change? |
| **Open/Closed** | Is the code open for extension but closed for modification? |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Can implementations be used wherever their interface is expected? |
| **Interface Segregation** | Are interfaces focused and clients not forced to depend on unused methods? |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Do high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions? |

### Separation of Concerns

- **Layering**: Code should be organized into logical layers (presentation, business logic, data access)
- **Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together
- **Coupling**: Dependencies between modules should be minimal and through interfaces
- **Single Source of Truth**: No duplicate logic or configuration

## Review Checklist

### Architecture & Design

- [ ] Modules have single, well-defined responsibilities
- [ ] Dependencies are injected rather than hardcoded
- [ ] Business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns
- [ ] New code follows existing architectural patterns
- [ ] No circular dependencies are introduced

### Code Quality

- [ ] Functions are small and focused (one responsibility per function)
- [ ] Naming clearly communicates intent
- [ ] Complex logic is broken into smaller, testable units
- [ ] Error handling is consistent and appropriate
- [ ] State is managed explicitly where needed

### Testing

- [ ] New code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Tests are isolated and deterministic
- [ ] Mock dependencies are appropriate

### Documentation

- [ ] Public APIs are documented
- [ ] Complex algorithms have explanatory comments
- [ ] TODOs are accompanied by issue references or explanations
- [ ] Configuration changes are documented

## Step-by-Step Review Process

### 1. Understand Context

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for project architecture, conventions, and gotchas
2. Check `_agent_docs/reviews/` for existing architectural reviews — **do not repeat findings already documented**, focus on what's new or changed
3. Check `_agent_docs/learnings/` for domain-specific knowledge relevant to areas you're reviewing
4. Understand the intended behavior and edge cases

### 2. Run a High-Level Design Review for each Domain

Focus on architecture and SOLID principles:

1. **Check module boundaries** - Are responsibilities properly separated?
2. **Trace data flow** - How does information move through the system?
3. **Identify tight coupling** - Are modules too interdependent?
4. **Evaluate extensibility** - Can new features be added without modification?

### 3. Detailed Code Review

#### For each file:

1. **Read the overall structure**
   - Are classes/functions organized logically?
   - Are related concerns grouped together?

2. **Review individual functions**
   - Is the function doing one thing?
   - Is it too long or complex?
   - Does it have appropriate parameters and return values?

3. **Check dependencies**
   - Are dependencies injected or created internally?
   - Are concrete modules depended on instead of interfaces?
   - Are circular dependencies present?

4. **Verify error handling**
   - Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
   - Is there proper validation of inputs?
   - Are edge cases considered?

### 4. Severity Calibration

Calibrate severity by **real-world impact**, not principle purity. A SOLID violation is only "Critical" if it will cause concrete problems.

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|-------
| **Critical** | Will cause bugs, data loss, crashes, or security issues | Division by zero, race conditions in async callbacks, unhandled Promise rejections, missing error handling |
| **Warning** | Will impede future changes, create maintenance burden, or hide bugs | God module, tight coupling, duplicated logic >50 lines, missing abstraction where mocking is needed |
| **Suggestion** | Improves code quality but no urgency | Module width, naming, dead Vue watchers, style consistency, documentation gaps |

**Common mis-calibrations to avoid:**
- Interface width (ISP): wide interfaces are a testing inconvenience, not a runtime risk → **Suggestion**
- Code duplication: only critical when the copies diverge or exceed ~50 lines → **Warning** if significant, **Suggestion** if cosmetic
- Switch on enum (OCP): only a warning if new cases are realistically expected → **Warning**
- God module: warn based on change-risk, not line count alone → **Warning** unless it blocks testing

### 5. Scope Beyond SOLID

SOLID principles are necessary but not sufficient. Also look for:

| Area | What to Check |
|------|--------------|
| **Resource management** | Memory retention, lazy loading, file handle leaks |
| **Persistence consistency** | Single source of truth for saved state, no bypass paths |
| **Concurrency** | Race conditions in async callbacks, Promise handling |
| **Numeric safety** | Division by zero, overflow, NaN propagation |
| **Logging/telemetry** | Consistent console usage, no duplicated loggers |
| **Dead code** | No-op expressions, unused properties, leftover debug code |

### 6. Provide Feedback

Format findings as: `ID: Severity — Title`, with file:line reference, code snippet, impact, and suggested fix. End with a summary table sorted by severity.

## Common Red Flags

### SOLID Violations

| Pattern | Problem | Typical Severity |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| God module | Violates SRP | Warning (assess change-risk) |
| Tight coupling | Violates DIP | Warning |
| Switch on enum | Violates OCP | Warning (if extensibility expected) |
| Interface with many methods | Violates ISP | Suggestion |

### Separation of Concerns Issues

- **Business logic in UI layer** - Move to service layer
- **Database queries in controllers** - Move to repository/DAO
- **Configuration in code** - Move to config files/environment
- **Duplicate logic** - Extract to shared utility

### Runtime Risks (Critical)

- Division by zero on unvalidated input
- Unhandled Promise rejections
- Race conditions in async callbacks
- Mutable shared state without synchronization
- Error swallowing in persistence paths
- Vue reactivity traps (mutating reactive data outside Vue's tracking)
