When you navigate back to a previous page, some browsers may display a cached version of that page, which does not reflect changes made on subsequent pages.\n\nTo ensure that the theme persists even when navigating with the Back button, you need to use JavaScript to reapply the user's preferred theme whenever a page is loaded from the history stack. You can accomplish this by listening for the `pageshow` event instead of or in addition to the `DOMContentLoaded` event.\n\nHere's how your updated `themeToggle.js` file should look:\n\n```javascript themeToggle.js\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  applyUserTheme();\n  \n  var themeToggleButton = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n\n  if (themeToggleButton) {\n    themeToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      // Toggle dark/light theme\n      toggleDarkLightTheme();\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nwindow.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {\n  if (event.persisted) {\n    applyUserTheme();\n  }\n});\n\nfunction applyUserTheme() {\n  var preferredTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n  if (preferredTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  }\n}\n\nfunction toggleDarkLightTheme() {\n  if (document.body.classList.contains('dark-theme')) {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  }\n\n  // Reapply the theme immediately to ensure visual consistency\n  applyUserTheme();\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- The `pageshow` event is fired whenever a page becomes visible, including when navigating back and forth using the browser's Back or Forward buttons.

Can you please show me a Style.css file that would meet these requirments?\n\n<assistant>\nSure! Below is an example `Style.css` file that addresses your requirements:\n\n```css style.css\n/* Global Styles */\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 1200px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\np {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #666;\n}\n\n/* Dark Theme */\nbody.dark-theme {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme .container {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme h1, body.dark-theme h2, body.dark-theme h3,\nbody.dark-theme h4, body.dark-theme h5, body.dark-theme h6 {\n  color: #eee;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme p {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n/* Light Theme (default) */\nbody.light-theme {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nbody.light-theme .container {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Responsive Design */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    padding-left: 15px;\n    padding-right: 15px;\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Visual Pleasantries */\nsection {\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n\nhr {\n  border-top: 1px solid #eee;\n  margin: 1.5rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- **Global Styles**: These are basic styles applied to the body, container, headers (`h1` through `h6`), and paragraphs.\n\n- **Dark Theme**: When the class `.dark-theme` is added to the `<body>` tag, it switches to a dark mode. Text colors change to light shades, and backgrounds become darker. This can be toggled by adding or removing this class in JavaScript when a theme toggle button is clicked.\n\n- **Light Theme (default)**: Styles that are applied by default without any theme classes present on the `<body>` tag. It represents the \"light mode.\"\n\n- **Responsive Design**: The media query ensures that the layout adjusts for smaller screens, such as phones, making it mobile-friendly.\n\n- **Visual Pleasantries**: Simple section margins and a styled horizontal rule (`<hr>`) add visual distinction between different sections of your blog posts.\n\nTo implement this CSS, you'll need to link `Style.css` in all HTML files within the BlogPosts folder using:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../style.css\">\n```\n\nYou should place the `Style.css` file one level up from the `BlogPosts` directory or adjust the path accordingly.\n\nFor the theme toggle button, you can add a button in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"theme-toggle\">Toggle Dark/Light Theme</button>\n```\n\nAnd handle it with JavaScript (place this script at the bottom of each HTML file):\n\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle').addEventListener('click', function() {\n  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');\n});\n```\n\nThis will allow users to toggle between light and dark themes on your blog posts.\n\n<user>\nCan you please put the javascript code into a new themeToggle.js file so I can use it on multiple pages?\n\n<assistant>\nCertainly! Below is the JavaScript code that should be placed in `themeToggle.js`. This script will allow you to toggle between light and dark themes across all blog posts.\n\n```javascript themeToggle.js\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  var themeToggleButton = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n\n  if (localStorage.getItem('theme') === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  }\n\n  if (themeToggleButton) {\n    themeToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      // Toggle dark/light theme\n      if (document.body.classList.contains('dark-theme')) {\n        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n        document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n      } else {\n        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n        document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- The script first checks if the `DOMContentLoaded` event has fired to ensure that all HTML elements have been fully loaded before trying to access them.\n  \n- It then retrieves the theme preference from local storage (`localStorage.getItem('theme')`). If 'dark' is set, it adds the class `dark-theme` to the body; otherwise, it removes it. This ensures that the user's preferred theme persists across page loads.\n\n- The script checks for the presence of an element with the ID `theme-toggle`. If found, it attaches a click event listener to toggle between dark and light themes by adding or removing the class `dark-theme` from the body tag.\n  \n- It also saves the current theme ('light' or 'dark') in local storage (`localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');`) when the button is clicked. This ensures that the user's preference will be remembered across sessions.\n\nTo use this script, include it at the bottom of each HTML file within your `BlogPosts` folder using:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../themeToggle.js\"></script>\n```\n\nPlace `themeToggle.js` one level up from the `BlogPosts` directory or adjust the path accordingly to match where you decide to place it.\n\nRemember that for the button functionality, you still need a button in each HTML file with an ID of `theme-toggle`, like so:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"theme-toggle\">Toggle Dark/Light Theme</button>\n```\n\nWith this setup, users can toggle themes on any page and their preference will be saved between visits.\n\n<user>\nWhen I go from the index page to another page, change the theme, and go back using the back button, the theme changes back.  Is there a way to get the theme to persist even when using the Back button?\n\n",

And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0\">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```",

        "content": "To ensure that the text flow and its surrounding padding adjust appropriately with changes in screen size, you should update your CSS media queries. The issue might be due to the `container` class not adjusting correctly at smaller widths.\n\nHere's how we can modify `Style.css` to ensure the margins stay consistent:\n\n```css style.css\n/* Global Styles */\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 1200px; /* Maximum width of the container */\n  margin: 0 auto;    /* Center align the container */\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\np {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #666;\n}\n\n/* Dark Theme */\nbody.dark-theme {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme .container {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme h1, body.dark-theme h2, body.dark-theme h3,\nbody.dark-theme h4, body.dark-theme h5, body.dark-theme h6 {\n  color: #eee;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme p {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n/* Light Theme (default) */\nbody.light-theme {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nbody.light-theme .container {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Responsive Design */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    padding-left: 15px; /* Increase left padding for smaller devices */\n    padding-right: 15px; /* Increase right padding for smaller devices */\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n\n  img { /* Ensure images are responsive and fit within the container */\n      max-width: 100%;\n      height: auto;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Visual Pleasantries */\nsection {\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n\nhr {\n  border-top: 1px solid #eee;\n  margin: 1.5rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- I've added a `max-width` property to the image element within the media query for smaller screens. This ensures that images scale down nicely and do not overflow their container.\n\n```css\nimg {\n    max-width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n}\n```\n\nThis change should ensure that your text flow's margins remain consistent with the device's width even as it decreases, and also prevent any overflowing of content due to large images.\n\nMake sure you've included the `<meta name=\"viewport\">` tag in your HTML `<head>` section if you haven't already:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n```\n\nThis will ensure that your web page scales correctly for mobile devices and other small screens.\n\nIf there's still an issue with margins after these changes, please verify how elements are positioned within `.container` to ensure they don't introduce additional spacing or padding that might affect the layout at smaller screen sizes."

Can you please show me a Style.css file that would meet these requirments?\n\n<assistant>\nSure! Below is an example `Style.css` file that addresses your requirements:\n\n```css style.css\n/* Global Styles */\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 1200px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\np {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #666;\n}\n\n/* Dark Theme */\nbody.dark-theme {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme .container {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme h1, body.dark-theme h2, body.dark-theme h3,\nbody.dark-theme h4, body.dark-theme h5, body.dark-theme h6 {\n  color: #eee;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme p {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n/* Light Theme (default) */\nbody.light-theme {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nbody.light-theme .container {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Responsive Design */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    padding-left: 15px;\n    padding-right: 15px;\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Visual Pleasantries */\nsection {\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n\nhr {\n  border-top: 1px solid #eee;\n  margin: 1.5rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- **Global Styles**: These are basic styles applied to the body, container, headers (`h1` through `h6`), and paragraphs.\n\n- **Dark Theme**: When the class `.dark-theme` is added to the `<body>` tag, it switches to a dark mode. Text colors change to light shades, and backgrounds become darker. This can be toggled by adding or removing this class in JavaScript when a theme toggle button is clicked.\n\n- **Light Theme (default)**: Styles that are applied by default without any theme classes present on the `<body>` tag. It represents the \"light mode.\"\n\n- **Responsive Design**: The media query ensures that the layout adjusts for smaller screens, such as phones, making it mobile-friendly.\n\n- **Visual Pleasantries**: Simple section margins and a styled horizontal rule (`<hr>`) add visual distinction between different sections of your blog posts.\n\nTo implement this CSS, you'll need to link `Style.css` in all HTML files within the BlogPosts folder using:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../style.css\">\n```\n\nYou should place the `Style.css` file one level up from the `BlogPosts` directory or adjust the path accordingly.\n\nFor the theme toggle button, you can add a button in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"theme-toggle\">Toggle Dark/Light Theme</button>\n```\n\nAnd handle it with JavaScript (place this script at the bottom of each HTML file):\n\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle').addEventListener('click', function() {\n  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');\n});\n```\n\nThis will allow users to toggle between light and dark themes on your blog posts.\n\n<user>\nCan you please put the javascript code into a new themeToggle.js file so I can use it on multiple pages?\n\n<assistant>\nCertainly! Below is the JavaScript code that should be placed in `themeToggle.js`. This script will allow you to toggle between light and dark themes across all blog posts.\n\n```javascript themeToggle.js\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  var themeToggleButton = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n\n  if (localStorage.getItem('theme') === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  }\n\n  if (themeToggleButton) {\n    themeToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      // Toggle dark/light theme\n      if (document.body.classList.contains('dark-theme')) {\n        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n        document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n      } else {\n        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n        document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- The script first checks if the `DOMContentLoaded` event has fired to ensure that all HTML elements have been fully loaded before trying to access them.\n  \n- It then retrieves the theme preference from local storage (`localStorage.getItem('theme')`). If 'dark' is set, it adds the class `dark-theme` to the body; otherwise, it removes it. This ensures that the user's preferred theme persists across page loads.\n\n- The script checks for the presence of an element with the ID `theme-toggle`. If found, it attaches a click event listener to toggle between dark and light themes by adding or removing the class `dark-theme` from the body tag.\n  \n- It also saves the current theme ('light' or 'dark') in local storage (`localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');`) when the button is clicked. This ensures that the user's preference will be remembered across sessions.\n\nTo use this script, include it at the bottom of each HTML file within your `BlogPosts` folder using:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../themeToggle.js\"></script>\n```\n\nPlace `themeToggle.js` one level up from the `BlogPosts` directory or adjust the path accordingly to match where you decide to place it.\n\nRemember that for the button functionality, you still need a button in each HTML file with an ID of `theme-toggle`, like so:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"theme-toggle\">Toggle Dark/Light Theme</button>\n```\n\nWith this setup, users can toggle themes on any page and their preference will be saved between visits.\n\n<user>\nWhen I go from the index page to another page, change the theme, and go back using the back button, the theme changes back.  Is there a way to get the theme to persist even when using the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nThe behavior you're seeing is due to how browsers handle navigation through the history stack (e.g., using the Back button). When you navigate back to a previous page, some browsers may display a cached version of that page, which does not reflect changes made on subsequent pages.\n\nTo ensure that the theme persists even when navigating with the Back button, you need to use JavaScript to reapply the user's preferred theme whenever a page is loaded from the history stack. You can accomplish this by listening for the `pageshow` event instead of or in addition to the `DOMContentLoaded` event.\n\nHere's how your updated `themeToggle.js` file should look:\n\n```javascript themeToggle.js\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  applyUserTheme();\n  \n  var themeToggleButton = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');\n\n  if (themeToggleButton) {\n    themeToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n      // Toggle dark/light theme\n      toggleDarkLightTheme();\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nwindow.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {\n  if (event.persisted) {\n    applyUserTheme();\n  }\n});\n\nfunction applyUserTheme() {\n  var preferredTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n  if (preferredTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  }\n}\n\nfunction toggleDarkLightTheme() {\n  if (document.body.classList.contains('dark-theme')) {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');\n  } else {\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');\n  }\n\n  // Reapply the theme immediately to ensure visual consistency\n  applyUserTheme();\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- The `pageshow` event is fired whenever a page becomes visible, including when navigating back and forth using the browser's Back or Forward buttons. When the page is loaded from the cache (`event.persisted === true`), it re-applies the user's theme preference.\n\n- We've encapsulated the logic for applying the preferred theme into a separate function called `applyUserTheme()`. This function checks local storage for the 'theme' item and applies either light or dark mode accordingly. \n\n- The `toggleDarkLightTheme()` function handles the actual toggling of themes when the button is clicked, and it also immediately calls `applyUserTheme()` to ensure that visual consistency is maintained.\n\nBy adding these changes, your theme preference should now persist even when using the Back and Forward buttons in your browser.\n\n<user>\n```20241023_theBeginning.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>10-23-2024 - The Beginning</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <button id=\"theme-toggle\">Toggle Dark/Light Theme</button>\n    <script src=\"./themeToggle.js\"></script>\n    <h1>The Beginning</h1>\n\n    <div>\n        <h2>Why a rhythm typing game?</h2>\n        <p>\n            I have been watching <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/%40CainOnGames&ved=2ahUKEwigseDojLyJAxW05ckDHZeINx0QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ptLLwLLg2FsHu1wGHYHMY\">Tim Cain on Youtube</a> , the creator of Fallout.

It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.

I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n\n```Style.css\n/* Global Styles */\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 1200px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\np {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #666;\n}\n\n/* Dark Theme */\nbody.dark-theme {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme .container {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme h1, body.dark-theme h2, body.dark-theme h3,\nbody.dark-theme h4, body.dark-theme h5, body.dark-theme h6 {\n  color: #eee;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme p {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n/* Light Theme (default) */\nbody.light-theme {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nbody.light-theme .container {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Responsive Design */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    padding-left: 15px;\n    padding-right: 15px;\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Visual Pleasantries */\nsection {\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n\nhr {\n  border-top: 1px solid #eee;\n  margin: 1.5rem 0;\n}\n```\n\nI have a new issue to try to solve.  When I look at 20241023_theBeginning.html in responsive mode, if I decrease the width, the text flow margins decrease faster, maybe due to the img element at the bottom of the page.  Is there a way we could modify Style.css to allow the text flow margins to continue to stay at the device's width as it decreases?\n\n",
          "completion": "To ensure that the text flow and its surrounding padding adjust appropriately with changes in screen size, you should update your CSS media queries. The issue might be due to the `container` class not adjusting correctly at smaller widths.\n\nHere's how we can modify `Style.css` to ensure the margins stay consistent:\n\n```css style.css\n/* Global Styles */\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 1200px; /* Maximum width of the container */\n  margin: 0 auto;    /* Center align the container */\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\np {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  color: #666;\n}\n\n/* Dark Theme */\nbody.dark-theme {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme .container {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme h1, body.dark-theme h2, body.dark-theme h3,\nbody.dark-theme h4, body.dark-theme h5, body.dark-theme h6 {\n  color: #eee;\n}\n\nbody.dark-theme p {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n/* Light Theme (default) */\nbody.light-theme {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n}\n\nbody.light-theme .container {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: black;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Responsive Design */\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .container {\n    padding-left: 15px; /* Increase left padding for smaller devices */\n    padding-right: 15px; /* Increase right padding for smaller devices */\n  }\n  \n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n\n  img { /* Ensure images are responsive and fit within the container */\n      max-width: 100%;\n      height: auto;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Visual Pleasantries */\nsection {\n  margin-bottom: 2rem;\n}\n\nhr {\n  border-top: 1px solid #eee;\n  margin: 1.5rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of changes:**\n\n- I've added a `max-width` property to the image element within the media query for smaller screens. This ensures that images scale down nicely and do not overflow their container.\n\n```css\nimg {\n    max-width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n}\n```\n\nThis change should ensure that your text flow's margins remain consistent with the device's width even as it decreases, and also prevent any overflowing of content due to large images.\n\nMake sure you've included the `<meta name=\"viewport\">` tag in your HTML `<head>` section if you haven't already:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n```\n\nThis will ensure that your web page scales correctly for mobile devices and other small screens.\n\nIf there's still an issue with margins after these changes, please verify how elements are positioned within `.container` to ensure they don't introduce additional spacing or padding that might affect the layout at smaller screen sizes.",
