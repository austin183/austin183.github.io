It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```",

It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.

And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0\">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.

And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0\">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n\n```src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n```\n\nI have 20241023_theBeginning.html , which references script.js .  When I click the toggle button, I get an error: \"index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: toggleTheme is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (index.html:13:65)\nonclick@index.html:13\".  How would I address the error so I can get the button on-click to find the toggleTheme method?\n\n<assistant>\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also use an event listener instead of the `onclick` attribute in your HTML:\n\n```html 20241023_theBeginning.html\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n<button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n```\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nIf you prefer to keep the `onclick` attribute in your HTML, you could also wrap your script in a self-invoking function to ensure it's executed after the DOM is loaded:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n(function() {\n  // ... existing code ...\n})();\n```\n\nHowever, using an event listener as shown above is generally considered better practice. \n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThis works well, but when I go from one page to the next, change the theme, and go back, the old theme is shown.  Is there a way I can keep the latest selected theme even when using the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nTo persist the theme across pages, you need to update the theme on every page load based on the value stored in local storage. Here's how you can modify your `script.js` file:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis code will check the value of `currentTheme` in local storage on every page load and apply it to the body. If you change the theme, it will be saved to local storage and applied when you navigate back to the previous page.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nNow when I click toggle, the theme does not change at all\n\n",

And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0\">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n\n```src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n```\n\nI have 20241023_theBeginning.html , which references script.js .  When I click the toggle button, I get an error: \"index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: toggleTheme is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (index.html:13:65)\nonclick@index.html:13\".  How would I address the error so I can get the button on-click to find the toggleTheme method?\n\n<assistant>\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also use an event listener instead of the `onclick` attribute in your HTML:\n\n```html 20241023_theBeginning.html\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n<button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n```\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nIf you prefer to keep the `onclick` attribute in your HTML, you could also wrap your script in a self-invoking function to ensure it's executed after the DOM is loaded:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n(function() {\n  // ... existing code ...\n})();\n```\n\nHowever, using an event listener as shown above is generally considered better practice. \n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThis works well, but when I go from one page to the next, change the theme, and go back, the old theme is shown.  Is there a way I can keep the latest selected theme even when using the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nTo persist the theme across pages, you need to update the theme on every page load based on the value stored in local storage. Here's how you can modify your `script.js` file:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis code will check the value of `currentTheme` in local storage on every page load and apply it to the body. If you change the theme, it will be saved to local storage and applied when you navigate back to the previous page.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nNow when I click toggle, the theme does not change at all\n\n<assistant>\nIt seems that there might be an issue with the way we're updating the `currentTheme` variable and the class on the body element. Here's a modified version of your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis modified version of your code checks if `currentTheme` is 'light' or 'dark', and then updates it accordingly. It also removes any existing classes from the body before applying the new one, which should prevent any conflicts.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\n```index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Austin183's Blog Posts</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"src/Style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Add this button to your HTML file -->\n    <button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n    <script src=\"src/script.js\"></script>\n    <h1>Midiestro Posts</h1>\n\n    <div>\n        <p>\n            These posts go into more detail about particular commits to the Midestro project.

And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0\">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are a few things I like to do:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Learn</li>\n                <li>Code</li>\n                <li>Play Games</li>\n                <li>Share Knowledge</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And there are a few things I am bad at:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Storytelling</li>\n                <li>Music</li>\n                <li>UI/UX Design</li>\n                <li>Complex Game Design</li>\n                <li>Original Ideas</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href=\"../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html\">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n\n```src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n```\n\nI have 20241023_theBeginning.html , which references script.js .  When I click the toggle button, I get an error: \"index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: toggleTheme is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (index.html:13:65)\nonclick@index.html:13\".  How would I address the error so I can get the button on-click to find the toggleTheme method?\n\n<assistant>\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also use an event listener instead of the `onclick` attribute in your HTML:\n\n```html 20241023_theBeginning.html\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n<button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n```\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nIf you prefer to keep the `onclick` attribute in your HTML, you could also wrap your script in a self-invoking function to ensure it's executed after the DOM is loaded:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n(function() {\n  // ... existing code ...\n})();\n```\n\nHowever, using an event listener as shown above is generally considered better practice. \n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThis works well, but when I go from one page to the next, change the theme, and go back, the old theme is shown.  Is there a way I can keep the latest selected theme even when using the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nTo persist the theme across pages, you need to update the theme on every page load based on the value stored in local storage. Here's how you can modify your `script.js` file:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis code will check the value of `currentTheme` in local storage on every page load and apply it to the body. If you change the theme, it will be saved to local storage and applied when you navigate back to the previous page.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nNow when I click toggle, the theme does not change at all\n\n<assistant>\nIt seems that there might be an issue with the way we're updating the `currentTheme` variable and the class on the body element. Here's a modified version of your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis modified version of your code checks if `currentTheme` is 'light' or 'dark', and then updates it accordingly. It also removes any existing classes from the body before applying the new one, which should prevent any conflicts.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\n```index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Austin183's Blog Posts</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"src/Style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Add this button to your HTML file -->\n    <button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n    <script src=\"src/script.js\"></script>\n    <h1>Midiestro Posts</h1>\n\n    <div>\n        <p>\n            These posts go into more detail about particular commits to the Midestro project.

It was using an event listener before, which worked with the button at index.html .  Can you please add back the event listener?  Aslo please keep in mind the theme should persist when navigating between links and using the Back Button or other History navigation features.\n\n<assistant>\nHere's how you can modify your `script.js` file to use an event listener again and keep the theme persistent across page navigations:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Add event listener to the button\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nThis code adds an event listener back to your `theme-toggle-button` and keeps the theme persistent across page navigations by saving it in local storage.\n\nIf you want the theme to be applied when you navigate back or forward using the browser's history features, you can add a small script that runs on every page load:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Apply the current theme on page load\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThe theme still switches back when I use the Back Button after making the switch on a page.  Is there any other event I should listen for after the user uses the Back button?\n\n",
          "completion": "Yes, you can listen for the `pageshow` event, which is triggered when a page is loaded or reloaded, including when the user navigates back to it using the Back button.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Function to apply the theme\nfunction applyTheme() {\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  }\n}\n\n// Apply the theme on page load and when navigating back\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\n  applyTheme();\n});\nwindow.addEventListener('pageshow', function() {\n  applyTheme();\n});\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ?

I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Once I built <a href=\"../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html\">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href=\"https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false\">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi\">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/\">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3\">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Main Page</h3>\n        <p>\n            By this point, the main <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html\">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js\">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>\n        <p>\n            The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88\">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114\">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>\n                <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>\n                <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>\n            </ul>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This process happened <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279\">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>\n        <p>\n            At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href=\"https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8\">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And now that future me is you!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <img src=\"images/spiderman.jpg\" />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n```\n\n```src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n```\n\nI have 20241023_theBeginning.html , which references script.js .  When I click the toggle button, I get an error: \"index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: toggleTheme is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (index.html:13:65)\nonclick@index.html:13\".  How would I address the error so I can get the button on-click to find the toggleTheme method?\n\n<assistant>\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also use an event listener instead of the `onclick` attribute in your HTML:\n\n```html 20241023_theBeginning.html\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n<button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n<!-- ... existing code ... -->\n```\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nIf you prefer to keep the `onclick` attribute in your HTML, you could also wrap your script in a self-invoking function to ensure it's executed after the DOM is loaded:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n(function() {\n  // ... existing code ...\n})();\n```\n\nHowever, using an event listener as shown above is generally considered better practice. \n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThis works well, but when I go from one page to the next, change the theme, and go back, the old theme is shown.  Is there a way I can keep the latest selected theme even when using the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nTo persist the theme across pages, you need to update the theme on every page load based on the value stored in local storage. Here's how you can modify your `script.js` file:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  if (currentTheme === 'light') {\n    // Switch to dark mode\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'dark';\n  } else {\n    // Switch to light mode\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis code will check the value of `currentTheme` in local storage on every page load and apply it to the body. If you change the theme, it will be saved to local storage and applied when you navigate back to the previous page.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nNow when I click toggle, the theme does not change at all\n\n<assistant>\nIt seems that there might be an issue with the way we're updating the `currentTheme` variable and the class on the body element. Here's a modified version of your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Expose the function to the global scope\nwindow.toggleTheme = toggleTheme;\n```\n\nThis modified version of your code checks if `currentTheme` is 'light' or 'dark', and then updates it accordingly. It also removes any existing classes from the body before applying the new one, which should prevent any conflicts.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\n```index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Austin183's Blog Posts</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"src/Style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Add this button to your HTML file -->\n    <button class=\"theme-toggle-button\" id=\"theme-toggle-button\">Toggle Theme</button>\n    <script src=\"src/script.js\"></script>\n    <h1>Midiestro Posts</h1>\n\n    <div>\n        <p>\n            These posts go into more detail about particular commits to the Midestro project.

It was using an event listener before, which worked with the button at index.html .  Can you please add back the event listener?  Aslo please keep in mind the theme should persist when navigating between links and using the Back Button or other History navigation features.\n\n<assistant>\nHere's how you can modify your `script.js` file to use an event listener again and keep the theme persistent across page navigations:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Set the initial theme\ndocument.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\nif (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Add event listener to the button\ndocument.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n```\n\nThis code adds an event listener back to your `theme-toggle-button` and keeps the theme persistent across page navigations by saving it in local storage.\n\nIf you want the theme to be applied when you navigate back or forward using the browser's history features, you can add a small script that runs on every page load:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// ... existing code ...\n\n// Apply the current theme on page load\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nThe theme still switches back when I use the Back Button after making the switch on a page.  Is there any other event I should listen for after the user uses the Back button?\n\n<assistant>\nYes, you can listen for the `pageshow` event, which is triggered when a page is loaded or reloaded, including when the user navigates back to it using the Back button.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Get the current theme from local storage\nlet currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n\n// If no theme is set, default to light mode\nif (!currentTheme) {\n  currentTheme = 'light';\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n}\n\n// Function to apply the theme\nfunction applyTheme() {\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  }\n}\n\n// Apply the theme on page load and when navigating back\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\n  applyTheme();\n});\nwindow.addEventListener('pageshow', function() {\n  applyTheme();\n});\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ? 'dark' : 'light';\n\n  // Update the body class based on the new theme\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode', 'light-mode'); // Remove any existing classes\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  } else {\n    document.body.classList.add('light-mode');\n  }\n\n  // Save the new theme to local storage\n  localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme);\n}\n\n// Add event listener to the button\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  document.getElementById('theme-toggle-button').addEventListener('click', toggleTheme);\n});\n```\n\nIn this code, we're listening for both `load` and `pageshow` events to apply the theme when the page is loaded or reloaded. This should ensure that the theme persists even after using the Back button.\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.\n\n<user>\nIt still switches back when I use the back button, even with these listenners.  What else could be missing?\n\n",
          "completion": "In that case, let's try to update the `currentTheme` variable after loading the page and before applying the theme.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```javascript src/script.js\n// Function to apply the theme\nfunction applyTheme() {\n  let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n  if (!currentTheme) {\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n    localStorage.setItem('theme', currentTheme); // Save the default theme\n  }\n\n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-mode'); // Remove any existing class\n  if (currentTheme === 'dark') {\n    document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');\n  }\n}\n\n// Function to toggle the theme\nfunction toggleTheme() {\n  let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n  if (!currentTheme) {\n    currentTheme = 'light';\n  }\n\n  // Check if the current theme is light or dark\n  currentTheme = (currentTheme === 'light') ?

This ensures that the theme is only reapplied when the page is loaded from the browser's cache (i.e., when navigating back).\n\nYou can use the Apply Button on the code block or switch to Agent Mode to make these suggested updates automatically.",
