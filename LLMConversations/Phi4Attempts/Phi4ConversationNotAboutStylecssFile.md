14 |         <p>
15 |             I have been watching <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/%40CainOnGames&ved=2ahUKEwigseDojLyJAxW05ckDHZeINx0QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ptLLwLLg2FsHu1wGHYHMY">Tim Cain on Youtube</a> , the creator of Fallout.  And one of his videos discussed an approach to starting off in game development at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHMFG8uvOb0">Coding Toys (Insomnia Edition)</a> .  It inspired me to build a toy, and that lead to the idea of a video game.  First, I had to take an inventory of myself, my skills, and my perseverance.  Thanks for the inspiration, Tim!  I am glad you couldn't sleep that night.  I always appreciate your insights.

18 |             There are a few things I like to do:
19 |             <ul>
20 |                 <li>Learn</li>
21 |                 <li>Code</li>
22 |                 <li>Play Games</li>
23 |                 <li>Share Knowledge</li>
24 |             </ul>
25 |         </p>
26 |         <p>
27 |             And there are a few things I am bad at:
28 |             <ul>
29 |                 <li>Storytelling</li>
30 |                 <li>Music</li>
31 |                 <li>UI/UX Design</li>
32 |                 <li>Complex Game Design</li>
33 |                 <li>Original Ideas</li>
34 |             </ul>
35 |         </p>
36 |         <p>
37 |             I first wanted to figure out how to use my keyboard as a piano, because that seemed like a good Learning and Coding activity to get familiar with my new <a href="../AboutThisDevelopmentEnvironment.html">Development Environment</a> .  I also wanted the result to be usable as broadly as possible, so it had to run in a plain old modern day web browser.  I used <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">ToneJS</a> for the music synthesis because I didn't want to reinvent the sound engineering wheel.  I would be terrible at that. I also used <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> to make the UI easier to work with. I used it previously on a couple of other pages already, and a new framework was not the focus of this project.
38 |         </p>
39 |         <p>
40 |             Once I built <a href="../MidiSongBuilder/Keybiano.html">the Keybiano page</a> , I needed to figure out how I could play it since I don't have any musical background.  At first I transcribed notes into json files by hand using sites like <a href="https://noobnotes.net/super-mario-bros-theme-nintendo/?solfege=false">Super Mario on NoobNotes</a>. I had to play the songs using my memory of the note timings.  It worked great, but adding new songs was a pain, and playing them on a static page was not much fun.  It was time to try new things.  Then I recalled the fun I had with games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Just Dance, etc... and I wanted to take my keyboard based piano to that experience.
41 |         </p>
42 |         <p>
43 |             My task was to figure out a way to get json with all the data I would need for a song, and that proved to be too much for my tiny attention span.  So I searched for ways to make use of existing midi files instead.  That led me to <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi">ToneJS/Midi</a> , which can take midi files and turn them into json objects usable with ToneJS.  I started with <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/">the ToneJS Midi Demo Page</a> , and I worked on incorporating the game elements on top of that.  This <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3">Github Commit</a> is the first result of that work.  All it did at this point was accept a midi file, and when you clicked on play, all the notes for the first track would fall down the canvas and play the provided song.  It was enough to convince me I was on a good path to building out a whole game.
44 |         </p>
45 |         <h3>Main Page</h3>
46 |         <p>
47 |             By this point, the main <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html">Midiestro page</a> is a mess of Keybiano and the ToneJS Midi demo page along with my first iteration of the <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js">SongNoteRenderer</a>.  The options were very bare bones at this point because just getting the page to move the notes was an huge accomplishment.  None of the notes were filtered out of the songs, but the player could only select a subset of notes from a single track anyway.  I knew there was a long way to go, but I felt confident that between me and my trusty Llama3.1 8b helper and a hand full of alternative models to query, I could figure out how to make a responsive rhythm game that could keep me entertained for minutes at a time.
48 |         </p>
49 |         <h3>SongNoteRenderer</h3>
50 |         <p>
51 |             The SongNoteRenderer was my first experience with the HTML canvas API.  I chose not to use any additional libraries at this point because I felt the page overhead was already pretty big with VueJS and the ToneJS libraries for Midi and WebAudio.  I figured my use case was simple enough, and I would benefit from understanding the canvas API if I ever did decide to make use of a game or animation library in the future.
52 |         </p>
53 |         <p>
54 |             I used Llama to get me started, trying to describe what I wanted to do and see what it could figure out.  I already had some idea of how it should go because I started with a simple text scroller in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L88">renderNotesPlaying</a> to get an idea of how the notes moved with the ToneJS now() value.  Then I used input from Llama to guide me to some good examples of canvas drawing on Google.  From there I decided to build <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/SongNoteRenderer.js#L114">renderNotesPlayingForCanvas</a> , which contained three concerns:
55 |             <ul>
56 |                 <li>Calculating the Visible Field over the next 10 seconds</li>
57 |                 <li>Generating instructions for each note in the Visible Field, like which note, position, and length of the box around the note</li>
58 |                 <li>Rendering the provided notes according to the provided instructions</li>
59 |             </ul>
60 |         </p>
61 |         <p>
62 |             This process happened <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/b1c1aa4fda9ae3d7e0d76e751a6c58949e7466b3/MidiSongBuilder/Midiestro.html#L274-L279">on this interval in the main page</a> every 20 milliseconds, which meant the game would play at about 50 frames per second.
63 |         </p>
64 |         <h3>Performance and Playability</h3>
65 |         <p>
66 |             At this point, the page needed all 20 milliseconds to process each frame of the game.  I tested the site on several machines, some of which had different performance profiles when plugged in or unplugged.  The lowest spec machine I tested with was an Asus ROG i7 4700HQ laptop.  It has an NVIDIA 850m graphics chip, but I ran the laptop on battery, with Linux Mint 22 with the GPU disabled.  When I played Nightmare Before Christmas, the page stuttered noticeably, but overall the effect was smooth enough for a first try.  The music stayed aligned with the notes on the canvas thanks to the use of Tone.now() to set the value of now in the song renderer method.  I knew I would need to make some changes to try to improve performance, because this game should be able to run on a potato.
67 |         </p>
68 |         <p>
69 |             The game was not really a game yet.  It was just disparate systems running at the same time.  I preciently had thoughts on what I should tackle and included them in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/498287b5488bcb2cccf515f5abccc647bed13ac8">an update to the Disclaimer</a>, knowing that a future me would want to remember what I was thinking at the time.
70 |         </p>
71 |         <p>
72 |             And now that future me is you!

10 |     <h1>Developing the Player Experience</h1>
11 | 
12 |     <div>
13 |         <h2>Debugging</h2>
14 |         <p>
15 |             I had an idea of how the notes fell down the canvas along with the time, and I had a rough understanding of Tone.now() worked, but there were things happening on the page I could not wrap my head around when I started pressing the Toggle Play button.  Trying to add a debugger was not very helpful due to how the game progressed in 20 millisecond increments.  So one of the first commits I made was to give myself more data while the game played.  You can see where I started adding more info to the debug version of the page in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/785f642bf8dc01d560c6f92c615c8923ecf326b4#diff-ac15ccf800e379bbd014973af85ca9620939a4b6228487432380666ab6beaaa1R122">this line on this commit.</a> .  This commit also had some code in it tied to the horizontal placement of the letters on the canvas, because some letters hung off the edges, and I needed to start making changes to understand how they would affect the frames.  By examining the time, duration, and initial x and y values, I was able to reverse engineer the calculations needed to get all the letters to appear within their boxes and within the canvas the way I expected them to appear.  The debug page was a valuable tool in getting things aligned correctly.
16 |         </p>
17 |         <h2>UI / UX Experience</h2>
18 |         <p>
19 |             I spent alot of time trying to get things to be more useful, like <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/4aa9e5599510b4e46d59816b9dee7678959efcd5#diff-d35fb48993fef7008d8e8885a3663313f5d87516bd3d0f0434969e75b1ffee7cR291">setting a delay so the player could have a chance to get ready before the notes were playing.</a> and <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/965a36dec109f9894888605535a907a376bbb907#diff-d35fb48993fef7008d8e8885a3663313f5d87516bd3d0f0434969e75b1ffee7cR90">adding a better naming scheme for the options in the Tracks dropdown menu.</a>
20 |         </p>
21 |         <h2>Scoring</h2>
22 |         <p>
23 |             No game is complete without a way to measure how well you played.  The code did not put me in a good position to add scoring as it was, so I had to take a bit of time to rearrange things to make room for scoring outside the Song Renderer.  One thing I had to do was move the concern of calculating the visible notes for the game from the Song Renderer and move it into the main page so that code for score keeping could happen between getting the visible notes and rendering them out to the page.  That change is captured in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/8197ac319d8743d2e81f6776b0f5c463024682c0">this commit.</a>
24 |         </p>
25 |         <p>
26 |             Once I had the concerns separated out, I could introduce <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/98be5a2ae161e112655837cdf605eb6c71b9e6ad">ScoreKeeper Component</a> and start keeping track of a score for the game.
27 |         </p>
28 |         <h2>Performance and Playability</h2>
29 |         <p>
30 |             The most I did to improve performance was to <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/8197ac319d8743d2e81f6776b0f5c463024682c0#diff-d35fb48993fef7008d8e8885a3663313f5d87516bd3d0f0434969e75b1ffee7cR305-R307">hide the text renderer when the page was not in debug mode.</a> It saved me a few extra loops, but nothing huge.  The addition of a score helped to give the game a feeling of interactivity, and it was the first time it really felt like a game.  It was not enough though.  I would need to add more interactivity to the canvas directly, and that is what I aimed to work on next.

10 |     <h1>Improving the Player Experience</h1>
11 | 
12 |     <div>
13 |         <h2>Game Options</h2>
14 |         <p>
15 |             The first thing I did was to make it so all the tracks' notes <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/3fbec572c811a989d9441392012ad073f7bbd878#diff-d35fb48993fef7008d8e8885a3663313f5d87516bd3d0f0434969e75b1ffee7cR280">were available to play at once.</a> I also added a minimum note duration to try to adjust how frequently keys needed to be played.  The notes all stacked on top of eachother in an overwhelming way, so I needed to work on how I could tune the rate of notes so the game didn't feel frustrating.
16 |         </p>
17 |         <p>
18 |             Later in the day, I also added an option for <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/3e857d034723348b0c391983325c967121208317#diff-73199e1619509d91631719f5b8ccad0f95f78ff4df4435bd32614a3a2b90d0e2R3">Minimum Note Distance</a>.  Note Duration did not turn out to be a very effective filtering tool, but the distance between two notes helped to keep the notes from stacking up overwhelmingly.  I exposed these settings so the player could set their own difficulty.
19 |         </p>
20 |         <h2>Visual Scoring</h2>
21 |         <p>
22 |             I needed a way to indicate how the player was doing as the game progressed, and the score board over the top of the canvas was inconvenient to look at with notes moving steadily down the playing field.  So I <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/30f0e0ba31b864a8eb3c1a81d00dc1f96e6f2414#diff-093af03c277b620cb74b977b7ec0696a1a393e34b5faa0c20c01dcbc0dc9d58bR48">worked on adding code to change the color of the notes indicating how they were scored.</a>  I went with a Green, Yellow, Red pattern because I am familiar with their meaning due to how stop lights work.  Green is good, yellow is caution, and red is bad.
23 |         </p>
24 |         <h2>Performance and Playability</h2>
25 |         <p>
26 |             I still hadn't addressed my performance issues yet.  I figured there would be no point in optimizing yet because I didn't know how much more I would need to say the game was functionally complete.  The game was still choppy, although I had moved to 10 millisecond intervals instead of 20 millisecond intervals because at 20 milliseconds, the scoring felt sluggish to respond.  With the change, the game still stuttered, but the scoring felt more responsive.
27 |         </p>
28 |         <p>
29 |             I started building up a set of optimizations in my head.  I believed my issue was looping over the notes so much every interval, so I started thinking of ways to trim them down.  I still had more bugs and and UI improvements I wanted to make too.  Having so much to do on my list and seeing how many things I was crossing off left me energised to keep working towards this game I really wanted to play.  I told my friends I was having just as much fun tweaking the game as play testing it.  In the back of my mind, I know I should write some Playwright tests for it.  One day I will!

14 |         <p>
15 |             I needed to try to get them out of the way when a player wanted to start the game.  The number of settings kept growing, and the Play button kept creeping further and further down out of sight.  In <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/d871fb0632038c78337aa512bc2c859032912dfe?diff=split">this commit</a>, I put a collapsible div around the game settings and added volume configurations so the player could set the track volume and key volume.
16 |         </p>
17 |         <h2>Scoring all the Notes</h2>
18 |         <p>
19 |             I knew I wanted a scoreboard, but I did not want to leave the player with an incomplete understanding of how they performed.  I needed to add events for notes that were outside the "good" and "ok" range in order to show how far away the player was from a perfect game.  The points are an arbitrary measure of success, but the counts of notes shows how much room the player has for improvement.  So I <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/1209fa4d86df3eda7fcef91317146d373218a44f#diff-d1b0737101e0f3090db006772fef899daeebba8ec9c12d1dd483672b5eeff828R58">added tags for "bad" and "missed" and added code to keep track of them in the Scorekeeper.</a>  The ranges are hard coded into the game <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/1209fa4d86df3eda7fcef91317146d373218a44f/MidiSongBuilder/MyComponents/ScoreKeeper.js#L2-L6">here.</a>

24 |                 <li>Marvelous: +/- 16.7 ms</li>
25 |                 <li>Perfect: +/- 33 ms</li>
26 |                 <li>Great: +/- 92 ms</li>
27 |                 <li>Good: +/- 142 ms</li>
28 |                 <li>Boo: +/- 225 ms</li>
29 |             </ul>
30 |             I could not for the life of me get anything other than "Good" when I played with this spread, and "Boo" was almost guaranteed.  I am not sure if it was due to my performance issues regarding stuttering and interval processing, and I wanted to make sure that all the ranges really worked, I went with a much more lenient time ranking system captured in the ScoreKeeper code.  Perhaps now that the game has some headroom in each of those 10ms intervals, I could go back and try to make them more strict again.
31 |         </p>
32 |         <p>
33 |             Once I had all the time rankings I wanted, and I had the notes changing colors according to their ranking as they passed the threshold, I was ready to <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/30eb35cd319ef0efbbc86ba62e1a8962807ea13d">added a Scoreboard after the song</a> to let the player review how they did.  It is not very eye catching, but it has the full raw score so the player understands everything that happened during the round at once.  There could be opportunities here to add some judgement animations, like a score out of 5 music notes or something.
34 |         </p>
35 |         <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
36 |         <p>
37 |             There were several bug fixes at this point that needed to be addressed before I could say I was happy with how the game worked mechanically.  I made a change to <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/986275f006d674bc1bfec250733aab3ba39f5dc2">stop the game when the song ended</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/eb8c453814e160ebe64d2a130b81f97d5568aba5">addressed a bug with trying to end the song</a>, and tried to clarify the notes further by <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/773cdceae6c535106bbe983ac188fe3d859b6522">removing the top and right hand sides of the note borders</a>.  This kept the notes from being obscured by the top of previous note boxes.
38 |         </p>
39 |         <h2>Performance and Playability</h2>
40 |         <p>
41 |             I spent some time tweaking the behavior of the page to approach how I wanted the game to play.  For instance, I changed what the Play button said depending on the game state <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/d871fb0632038c78337aa512bc2c859032912dfe?diff=split#diff-d35fb48993fef7008d8e8885a3663313f5d87516bd3d0f0434969e75b1ffee7cR371">here to let the player know what will happen next time they hit the button.</a>
42 |         </p>
43 |         <p>
44 |             I also tried to make the notes more readable by <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/1209fa4d86df3eda7fcef91317146d373218a44f#diff-d1b0737101e0f3090db006772fef899daeebba8ec9c12d1dd483672b5eeff828R58">capitalizing them.</a>  This had the effect of keeping the whole letter above the underlining border, where characters like "j" and "y" would cross through the border, obscuring the letter the player needed to press.
45 |         </p>
46 |         <p>
47 |             I also <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/5fa9ae56d5902e8de2c98073ed7c5b483b6807c3">shifted the playing field up so the bottom portion of the represented a second in the past.</a>  This let the player see how they were doing based on the colors of the letters before the letters disappeared.  It also gave them a chance to try to catch notes they missed that were still in the scoring ranges.
48 |         </p>
49 |         <p>
50 |             Now that I had reached Feature Complete in my head, it was time to remove as much processing from the game intervals as possible.  Even though the game was a stuttering mess, I felt accomplished writing a working game.  I went to bed with dreams of optimizations and how good the game would feel when it played at a smooth 100 frames per second.  
51 |         </p>
52 |         <h2>Gathering Feedback</h2>
53 |         <p>
54 |             At this point, I started sharing a link to the game with people to see how they felt about it.  There was some interest, but alot of people said they were just on their phones and could not get to a keyboard. Potential players in front of a browser with a keyboard still had the hurdles of searching for their own midi file to play, downloading the file, and dragging the file into the midi drop area.  As the developer of the game, with several midi files downloaded and well practiced at organizing my screen for dragging, dropping, playing, debugging, and coding, I didn't actually understand what kept players from playing at this point.
55 |         </p>
56 |         <p>
57 |             I decided that they would love it once I optimized it.  Surely it was the players who were wrong.

10 |     <h1>Optimizing at Random</h1>
11 |     <p>
12 |         At this point, I didn't know what was slowing down the interval processing, so I tried using Firefox and Chromium to find bottlenecks in the system.  I ignored things that didn't look like they were coming from my code.  I felt like the libraries and the canvas api call itself were probably already optimized by the browser developers.  Nothing really jumped out at me this way, so I started looking for things in my code that were unnecessary or could be written in a faster way.  I also asked the AI's what they thought, but since I didn't have anything in particular, they gave me vagure or hallucinatory answers.  Nothing I felt worth pursuing.
13 |     </p>
14 |     <div>
15 |         <h2>Building the Visible Field</h2>
16 |         <p>
17 |             One of the first things I did was <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/e18253bc70720b94c0e4a1f0ba7c5639bc8fffdb">pull the Visible Field filter process out of the interval and ran it once for the whole song.</a>  That took a whole loop out of the interval.  I know what <a href="https://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf">Big O notation is, </a> but I didn't really use it formally when I was choosing what to optimize, but I know at a high level, I want to process as few loops per interval as possible.  If I were to imagine that whatever my current complexity was per interval was, "T(n)", my complexity now would be "T(n) - O(n)".  This by itself may have been noticeable, but I was only ever playing the game after making a change.  To me it felt a little smoother, but it did not make a big difference over all.  Still, lots of tiny optimizations are better than no optimizations!
18 |         </p>
19 |         <h2>Reducing Iterations Per Loop</h2>
20 |         <p>
21 |             After some small tweaks like <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/5219ceee16fdf7bb547438dab4e3f6b594aa1113">decreasing the number of player synths</a> and <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/4a004d3648d399c70b7c6d935f2e9faf9d7fa3d1">trying to change some if's to switches</a>, I decided to try to cut down on the number of iterations the loops were spending going over notes in the song that were outside the current window.  Let's say the song was 4 minutes long, with 1000 notes.  During a 10 second window into the song, there may only be 30 notes to consider (don't judge my math).  So I <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/18d6c650a409a8155963899af480f759dccebf6d">tried to cut down to just the segment of the song I needed to process for the game at each moment</a>.  So my new level of complexity would be something like "T(n) - O(n) - 0(n - n/100)" (don't judge my Big O notation).  This again felt a little smoother, and it was definitely more efficient.  It still did not move the needle enough for me to hit the 100 frames per second goal, so I needed to figure out where else I could squeeze water from the stone.

23 |         <h2>Adding Time Delays to Help ToneJS with Scheduling</h2>
24 |         <p>
25 |             Sometimes when the game stuttered, it also made popping noises during play.  I found <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Performance#scheduling-in-advance">some helpful ToneJS documentation regarding performance</a> and implemented a <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/e1f7d8911956beffd678b4b3f820c2b12f463184">change to add slight delays</a> to try to keep the popping from occuring.  
26 |         </p>
27 |         <h2>Performance and Playability</h2>
28 |         <p>
29 |             Nothing much changed with the performance or playability of the game.  I felt like I was learning things, and I was getting into a more efficient mindset.  So even though it felt like there was very little tangible progress, I was already eager to try new things the next day.

10 |     <h1>Digging into the Canvas API</h1>
11 |     <div>
12 |         <h2>Revisiting the Browser Performance Profilers</h2>
13 |         <p>
14 |             I felt like I had optimized my own code pretty well, and I was running out of ideas on what I could improve there.  So I decided to take another look at the Performance Profiler in Firefox and Chromium and see what else could be hogging so much of that 10 millisecond interval.  
15 |         </p>
16 |         <p>
17 |             In Firefox 132, if you open the Web Developer Tools (F12), and go to the Performance tab, you can record a website's performance profile for a period of time.  I would start the profiler and play a song and then review the results to see what was taking up so much time.  Here is how the Firefox Profiler showed the game after the modest optimizations from the day before:
18 |         </p>
19 |         <p>
20 |             <img src="images/SmallFFBCO.jpg" />
21 |         </p>
22 |         <p>
23 |             I circled the part that I was going to try to reduce first.  The way the screen reads, I think, is that 47% of total processing time during the game was spent in the interval.  Within that 47%, 9.5%, or roughly 1/5 of the processing time was spent drawing the letters to the screen.  This seemed like something I could take a look at.  I remembered earlier when I was developing the song renderer, I may need to cache each letter to keep it from having to reprocess the letter each time, but I didn't understand what the letters were at the time to make a difference.
24 |         </p>
25 |         <h2>Prerendering and Caching the Notes</h2>
26 |         <p>
27 |             I started Googling ways to reduce the time spent drawing the letters to the canvas, and I came across <a href="https://github.com/simonsarris/Canvas-tutorials/blob/master/verticalText.js">this code that does just that.</a>  It was such <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8237081"></a>a great find on Stack Overflow from Simon Sarris.</p>  Thank you, Simon!
28 |         </p>
29 |         <p>
30 |             I implemented the change in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/3adfd71324b34593b4bc64d15196b3d3e44118b3"> this commit.</a>  There were some other optimizations to <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/commit/e99fc21fe70782319be0615b225430acd5d50b71">try to get pre-rendered draw instructions</a>, but overall, that change did not make a big difference.
31 |         </p>
32 |         <h2>Performance and Playability</h2>
33 |         <p>
34 |             The game plays better after the caching changes, but when I look at the Profiles between the version before caching and after caching, I am confused by the results.  I expected the % for canvas draws to go down after the cache changes, but they actually went up:
35 |         </p>
36 |         <p>
37 |             <img src="images/NowVsBefore.jpg" />
38 |         </p>
39 |         <p>
40 |             I think perhaps I misunderstood what the Firefox Profiler was telling me.  Maybe that is the percentage of overall samples taken during the recording, and the higher number means there were more drawImage calls to sample because they happened so much more often... I am really not sure.  I will need to look at the performance tools in Chromium and see if they make it clearer why the caching made such a difference.
41 |         </p>
42 |         <h3>Chromium Profile Results</h3>
43 |         <p>
44 |             I think I understand what the Chromium Profile is telling me more than the Firefox one, but I could still be mistaken in my analysis.  I went ahead and captured results for 3 instances of the game.  Here they are side by side for comparison.
45 |             <table>
46 |                 <tr>
47 |                   <th>Before Optimizations</th>
48 |                   <th>After Optimizing by Reducing Loops</th>
49 |                   <th>After Optimizing by Caching Prerendered Notes</th>
50 |                 </tr>
51 |                 <tr>
52 |                   <td><img src="images/PreOptimizationsMidiestroSummary.png" /></td>
53 |                   <td><img src="images/PrecachingMidiestroSummary.png" /></td>
54 |                   <td><img src="images/CurrentMidiestroSummary.png" /></td>
55 |                 </tr>
56 |               </table>
57 |         </p>
58 |         <p>
59 |             Looking at the comparison between the three versions, it looks like I got the most savings in scripting time from reducing the number of loops and iterations.  The prerendered notes look like they improved the scripting time slightly.  I am surprised the painting and rendering time remained constant.  The rendering time was the lowest on the prerendered version, but a 100 milliseconds out of the whole 3 minutes were probably not that big of a concern.  I think what really helped was the background scheduling.  Since the scripting was using so much less time in the later iterations, there was more time per interval for the sounds to play at the expected time and the frames to render before the next interval.  The idle time vs total time went up in each iteration, which is good for everyone.  That means there is more headroom for lower spec machines to play the game at the intended framerate, and there are lower odds of stutters for all machines.  
60 |         </p>
61 |         <h2>Gathering Feedback</h2>
62 |         <p>
63 |             The game finally played the way I wanted it to play!  It didn't have any flashy bells and whistles.  It would not try to hook players psychologically with endorphin inducing animations or spectacles in order to suck hours away from other important games they were playing.  It would just play satisfyingly, and player could spend minutes or hours playing depending on how they felt.
64 |         </p>
65 |         <p>
66 |             Despite my efforts to make the game play as smoothly as possible, everyone bounced off the game because I was still neglecting a serious aspect. Players were not ready to play because there were no songs out of the box.  Sure, there were instructions on how to get songs and then load them into the game, but I was giving people a huge reason to not invest time trying the game out.  If I, the developer, could not be bothered to provide a song to play, why should the player be bothered to do it?  They had other games that came ready to play.  The best response I got from friends was, "I am going to set aside time to play, but I will need to set it up first."
67 |         </p>
68 |         <p>
69 |             I would not even acknowledge the problem for another few days.  I am kicking myself in hindsight now, because some people I introduced to the game to early may have bounced off and will never go back to see it.

10 |     <h1>Writing Unit Tests to Keep from Making New Bugs</h1>
11 |     <div>
12 |         <h2>What was my Problem?</h2>
13 |         <p>
14 |             I kept introducing new songs that kept cropping up new odd behaviors in the <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/main/MidiSongBuilder/MyComponents/VisibleFieldFilterer.js">Visible Field Filterer implementation.</a>  After trying new algorithms with some rewrites and suggestions from the AI muddying the waters, I decided I needed to pull back and do some honest Unit Testing around what I wanted out of the method.
15 |         </p>
16 |         <h2>Writing the Tests</h2>
17 |         <p>
18 |             I wanted to stay consistent with this project being fully runnable from the Web Browser.  I found Mocha.js to have a good html only implementation.  Since I was already familiar with how to write unit tests in Mocha that run from a node server, I ran with it so I didn't have to create a new learning topic for the project.  I was able to get the specifications for the filter method defined in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/main/MidiSongBuilder/MyComponents/VisibleFieldFiltererTest.html">the VisibleFieldFiltererTest Webpage.</a>
19 |         </p>
20 |         <h2>Getting Llama to Understand the Intent Behind the Tests</h2>
21 |         <p>
22 |             I wanted Llama to write the method for me, but first I wanted to make sure it understood what the method should do.  I had a discussion with it to go over the tests firsts and then asked it to write the method.  You can see the discussion here: <a href="./references/Llama3.370bVisibleFieldDiscussion.html">Llama 3.3 70b - Visible Field Filterer Discussion</a>

**Assistant:**

<thought>I need to understand the current environment and determine what task is required. The directory structure suggests a focus on music, particularly MIDI files, and possibly some web development or visualization tasks.</thought>

<action>
  <command>ls</command>
  <args>
    <arg>/Users/runner/work/MidiSongBuilder/MidiSongBuilder/PublicDomainSongs/midi</arg>
  </args>
</action>

<thought>The `ls` command will help me list the contents of the MIDI directory to understand what files are available and potentially identify any tasks related to these files.</thought>

**Assistant:**

To accomplish the task of integrating a new blog post into your existing website structure, we will follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Existing Structure**: 
   - The current workspace contains `BlogPosts/index.html`, which likely serves as an index or landing page for all blog posts.
   - There is also a specific blog post file: `20241023_theBeginning.html`.
   - A markdown file, `PrettifyPrompt.md`, might contain additional content or instructions related to the blog.

2. **Determine New Blog Post Details**:
   - Identify the title and date for the new blog post.
   - Prepare the HTML content for the new blog post.

3. **Create a New HTML File for the Blog Post**:
   - Name the file using a consistent naming convention, such as `YYYYMMDD_title.html`.

4. **Update Index Page**:
   - Modify `BlogPosts/index.html` to include a link or reference to the new blog post.

5. **Verify and Test**:
   - Ensure all links are working correctly.
   - Open the updated index page in a browser to verify the integration.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

#### Step 1: Create New Blog Post HTML File

- **File Name**: Determine the date and title for the new blog post. For example, if the new post is titled "My Journey" and dated April 24, 2025, name it `20250424_myJourney.html`.
  
- **Content**: Prepare the HTML content for this file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Journey</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>This is the content of my journey blog post...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 2: Update Index Page

- **Modify `BlogPosts/index.html`**: Add a link to the new blog post.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Blog Posts</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="20241023_theBeginning.html">The Beginning</a></li>
        <li><a href="20250424_myJourney.html">My Journey</a></li> <!-- New Link -->
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 3: Verify and Test

- **Open `BlogPosts/index.html`**: Use a browser to ensure the new link is functional and leads to the correct blog post.

```bash
open BlogPosts/index.html
```

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, you will have successfully integrated a new blog post into your website. If there are any specific details or additional content needed for the new blog post, please provide them so I can assist further.
