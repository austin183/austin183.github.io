# Creating a Style.css for BlogPosts
We want a central Style.css sheet to apply to all the html files in the BlogPosts folder, 1 level deep.  

# Adding a Dark and Light Theme Button to all Blog Post Pages
We want the option to change the text from white on black to black on white to help with readability.

# Adding Visual Pleasantries
It would be nice if the page remained readable on a phone and on a computer, but a bit of visual distinction between sections would be nice.
