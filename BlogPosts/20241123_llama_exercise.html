    <h1>Writing Unit Tests to Keep from Making New Bugs</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>What was my Problem?</h2>
        <p>
            I kept introducing new songs that kept cropping up new odd behaviors in the <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/main/MidiSongBuilder/MyComponents/VisibleFieldFilterer.js">Visible Field Filterer implementation.</a>  After trying new algorithms with some rewrites and suggestions from the AI muddying the waters, I decided I needed to pull back and do some honest Unit Testing around what I wanted out of the method.
        </p>
        <h2>Writing the Tests</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to stay consistent with this project being fully runnable from the Web Browser.  I found Mocha.js to have a good html only implementation.  Since I was already familiar with how to write unit tests in Mocha that run from a node server, I ran with it so I didn't have to create a new learning topic for the project.  I was able to get the specifications for the filter method defined in <a href="https://github.com/austin183/austin183.github.io/blob/main/MidiSongBuilder/MyComponents/VisibleFieldFiltererTest.html">the VisibleFieldFiltererTest Webpage.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Llama to Understand the Intent Behind the Tests</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted Llama to write the method for me, but first I wanted to make sure it understood what the method should do.  I had a discussion with it to go over the tests firsts and then asked it to write the method.  You can see the discussion here: <a href="./references/Llama3.370bVisibleFieldDiscussion.html">Llama 3.3 70b - Visible Field Filterer Discussion</a>
